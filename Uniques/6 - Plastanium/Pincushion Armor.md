# Description
> [!citation]
> This *Unique* armor set uses an experimental plasmeld layer to absorb dart impacts. In the earliest versions, the darts would stick in the gel-like outer layer, leaving the wearer bristling with darts like a pincushion. Through that flaw has been perfected, the name persists.
