# Description
> [!citation]
>Tio Holtzman was patron to the nobleman Niko Bludd, tho provided funding for his research. One day this would lead to the development of the Holtzman effect, but earlier experiments such as this *Unique* engine are another result of that collaboration. The name has been corrupted over the centuries since.
