# Description
> [!citation]
> This *Unique* sword contains a series of toxin releasing nodules along the length of the blade. When struck with enough force, these nodules release a burst of poisonous gas — capable of passing through a shield. The Maas Kharet probably borrowed this design from the slavers — filling it with a poison of their own.
