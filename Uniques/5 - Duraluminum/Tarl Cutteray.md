# Description
> [!citation]
> When Pardot Kynes began his work with the fremen, he brought them into the imperial testing stations as laborers. He gave them access to the technology and science of the Imperium. Soon enough, cutterays began appearing in Sietchs, sculpting tunnels and windtraps to help with Pardot's long terms plans. This *Unique* cutteray has been optimized for the Ores and rock deposits on the area around Sietch Tarl.
