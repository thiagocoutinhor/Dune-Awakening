> This *Unique* scattergun was first discovered aboard the wreck of the Euporia in the Sheol. The crew and weapons on board were Ixian, leading to speculation that the weapon was sidestepping the prohibitions of the Butlerian Jihad. However when the weapon was opened up, it was a disappointingly standard application of heat transference principles.
