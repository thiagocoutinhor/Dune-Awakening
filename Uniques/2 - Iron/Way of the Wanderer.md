# Description
> [!citation]
> This *Unique* Maula pistol has a modified spring mechanism that automatically reloads darts without releasing trigger pressure. Rumor has it that Count Hasimir Fenring designed this modification himself, admiring the design of the maula pistol while decrying the inefficiency of its firing mechanism.
