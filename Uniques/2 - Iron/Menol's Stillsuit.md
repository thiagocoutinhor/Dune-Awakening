# Description
> [!citation]
> Menol was well loved among the Kirab, known far and wide for his spice beer brewing operations. He accidentally discovered that soaking his stillsuit leathers led to a stiffer, more protective *Unique* garment. Like his spice beer, he shared this knowledge freely, didn't help him much when he was stabbed to death by a drunk Kirab who hallucinated he was a sandworm.
