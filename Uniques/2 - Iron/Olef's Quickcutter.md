# Description
> [!citation]
> When Olef was assigned to the great ironworks in Vermillius Gap, he didn’t despair. He saw opportunity amongst the spires of stone — a lot of thirsty miners and nowhere to drink. He started stealing supplies and set up his own little after-hours establishment selling spice-laced moonshine. Before long, he was so busy he had no time to fill his mining quotas. He had a drunk engineer create this *Unique* cutteray to help him stay afloat.
