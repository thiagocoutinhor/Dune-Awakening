# Description
> [!citation]
> The story of the warlord Mendia is well known among the Kirab. How she escaped slavery in the north, abandoning her former life. How she gained a reputation for brutality by executing any slavers they captured. How she defeated their former leader, Aren, in a duel and drove him into hiding in the Southern Haggga Basin. This *Unique* armor is modelled after her own - reinforced to keep her enemies at bay.
