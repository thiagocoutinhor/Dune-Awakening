> Crafted to the same general standards of other Dew Reapers, this particular design was modified by Thufir Hawat to ease the lives of the Atreides pyons. This *Unique* Dew Reaper siphons a portion of the Holtzman field that powers the collection of dew to lighten the Dew Reaper itself, allowing an easier swing, lighter load and more efficiency in the long run.
