# Description
> [!citation]
> Scipio was a Kirab Warlord who took over the Wreck of the Pallas when it fell during the war of assassins. Over time, Scipio became known for his brutal torture of those who trespassed on his territory. He would extract most of the blood from their bodies, then abandon them near the leaking radiation core by the engines of the Pallas. This *Unique* blood bag is able to tolerate large amounts of reuse â€“ a reminder of its twisted legacy.
