# Description
> [!citation]
> Smiley Tyg sometimes has special goods that he sells with no questions asked or answered. A few seasons ago, schematics for a *Unique* high-capacity disruptor - a weapon focused on attacking shields - began to appear in his stock at the Anvil Tradepost. Rumors that they were plundered from a Sardaukar convoy ambushed by Zantara the Lion earned them their moniker as the Legion Tattoo - bolstered by the rhythm they make as they fire.
