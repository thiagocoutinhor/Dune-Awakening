# Description
> [!citation]
> Iri was a leader among the Kirab who became obsessed with finding a way to nullify the Holtzman effect. His tinkering led to the development of these *Unique* gauntlets that use a feedback loop to decrease power usage. Iri himself claimed that the gauntlets "spoke" to him and his state of mind deteriorated greatly until he threw himself from a cliff.
