# Description
> [!citation]
> During the Butlerian Jihad, pulse-swords were used to cut through the thinking machines and damage their electronics with pulses of deadly electricity. It is said that the secret of their making was lost during the ensuing centuries. This *Unique* blade gives a small jolt of electrical energy to the palms when parrying an enemy â€“ offering a small stamina boost. A far cry from the legendary swords of the Butlerian Jihad.
