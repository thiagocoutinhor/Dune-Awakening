# Description
> [!citation]
> Sim found that if he crossed the wires in his power pack just so, he could create a *Unique* power pack that recharged quickly – but with a slightly reduced power pool. Sim’s power pack became known as ‘old sparky’ for its constant discharge of electrical sparks – but his technique was copied widely by those who value speed over duration.
