# Description
> [!citation]
> Amongst the Kirab there is a common expression "there is only the final oath". The Kirab know how close they are to the edge, to becoming what they despise, scavengers without friend or family, consigned to the southern reaches of Hagga Basin. This *Unique* armor is a remnant of those who have forsaken their final oath - their oath to the Kirab themselves
