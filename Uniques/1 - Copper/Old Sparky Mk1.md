# Description
> [!citation]
> Sim found that if he crossed the wires in his power pack just so, he could create a *Unique* power pack that recharged quickly - but with a slightly reduced power pool. Sim's power pack became known as 'old sparky' for it's constant discharge of electrical sparks - but his technique was copied widely by those who value speed over duration.
