# Description
> [!citation]
> A prop from the famous play 'My Father's Shadow', this *Unique* suspensor belt is used by Jongleurs for short, but effective bursts of floating during performances. Jump twice to activate and float upwards. Suspensor fields are notorious for preserving momentum, and they deplete power as long as they are kept activated.
