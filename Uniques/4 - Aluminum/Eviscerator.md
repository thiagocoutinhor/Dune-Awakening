# Description
> [!citation]
> thin spikes in the barrel mean that the darts fired from this *Unique* scattergun will break into multiple sharpnel pieces on impact, causing a bleeding effect on enemies. Sandflies propaganda states that this weapon was used against them when they rebelled, though there are no records of the mining guild ever having access to such weapons.
